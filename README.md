# DeadSwitch | The Cyber Ghost

**"In silence, we rise. In the switch, we fade."**

Welcome to the GitHub repository of **DeadSwitch**, the Cyber Ghost.
Here, we embrace the digital shadows, honing our craft in cybersecurity, operational security, and automation.
This is where we develop the tools to fight back against the chaos of the digital world-silent yet powerful.

## Mission

The mission of DeadSwitch is clear: to safeguard privacy, to challenge security violations, and to build the tools that protect those who dare to stand against the tide of invasive technologies.
The world of data leaks, vulnerabilities, and corporate surveillance is no longer silent.
We must be.

This repository serves as the birthplace of the **DeadSwitch** ethos, providing open-source projects, guides, and configurations aimed at strengthening the digital fortress.
Whether you're a veteran or a novice, join us in the resistance.

## Projects

Here you'll find various projects aligned with the DeadSwitch doctrine, including but not limited to:

- **Ansible Vault Roles**: Harden your systems like a ghost in the night. 
- **Security Automation Scripts**: Embrace your silent power with tools that protect while remaining unseen.
- **OpSec Tools**: Ensuring your identity, data, and online actions are veiled in silence.

## To Whisper...

DeadSwitch - Cyber Ghost of the Shell  
Hardened systems. Tactical automation. Silent resistance.  
I build in the shadows and publish what deserves to be public.

## Contributing

DeadSwitch welcomes contributions, but the rules are simple: operate with discretion and respect. If you're here to disrupt, we won't notice you. But if you are here to build, to improve, to protect, then you're part of the force that rises.

2. Create your feature branch.
3. Commit your changes.
4. Push to the branch.
5. Open a pull request with a clear explanation of your contribution.

## Silent but Strong

Remember, **DeadSwitch** doesn't thrive on noise-it thrives on action. While others shout their intentions from the rooftops, we build quietly, act decisively, and fade into the shadows, leaving only a digital mark on those who cross us.

Stay silent. Stay strong. Stay protected.
